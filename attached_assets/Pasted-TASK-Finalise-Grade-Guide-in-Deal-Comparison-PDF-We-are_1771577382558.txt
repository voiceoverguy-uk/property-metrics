TASK: Finalise Grade Guide in Deal Comparison PDF

We are refining the Grade Guide table recently added to the Deal Comparison PDF.

GOALS:
1) Fix encoding issue (replace ≥ symbol with plain text).
2) Add missing Grade “E” band.
3) Make grade structure consistent and complete (A–F).
4) Slightly strengthen disclaimer language (optional extra safety line).
5) Do NOT change any calculations or grade logic.

-----------------------------------------
A) FIX SYMBOL ISSUE
-----------------------------------------

Replace any special characters like ≥ with plain text.

Instead of:
(≥8%)

Use:
(8% or higher)

Avoid any non-ASCII symbols in the PDF to prevent encoding glitches.

-----------------------------------------
B) UPDATE GRADE GUIDE TABLE
-----------------------------------------

Update the Grade Guide section in the Deal Comparison PDF to:

Title:
Grade Guide

Helper line (keep):
Grades are calculated automatically using Net Yield (Asset) bands.

Table columns:
| Grade | Meaning | Yield Band | Based On |

Rows:

A | Excellent – very strong yield | 8% or higher | Net Yield (Asset)
B | Strong – solid performance | 7% – 7.99% | Net Yield (Asset)
C | Fair – acceptable return | 6% – 6.99% | Net Yield (Asset)
D | Weak – below target yield | 5% – 5.99% | Net Yield (Asset)
E | Very weak – high caution | 4% – 4.99% | Net Yield (Asset)
F | Poor – low return | Below 4% | Net Yield (Asset)

NOTES:
- Do not use emotional or advisory wording.
- Keep tone neutral and analytical.
- Table styling should remain compact and professional:
  - Font size ~10–11px
  - Light grey header row
  - 1px light grey borders
  - ~85–90% width centred
  - Subtle spacing

-----------------------------------------
C) DISCLAIMER ENHANCEMENT
-----------------------------------------

Below the existing disclaimer, add one additional sentence:

“Results are based solely on the information entered and do not account for void periods, maintenance shocks, taxation changes or market risk.”

Keep formatting consistent with the existing disclaimer box.
Do not make it visually dominant.
Do not increase box size dramatically.

-----------------------------------------
D) IMPORTANT
-----------------------------------------

- No changes to grade calculation logic.
- No changes to sorting.
- No UI changes on the live site.
- PDF output must remain forced to light mode.
- Ensure pagination still works correctly.
- If space runs out on page 1, Grade Guide moves cleanly to page 2.
