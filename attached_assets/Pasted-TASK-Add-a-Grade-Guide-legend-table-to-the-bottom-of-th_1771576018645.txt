TASK: Add a “Grade Guide” legend table to the bottom of the Deal Comparison PDF (and any other PDF exports where there is spare space), using clean, subtle styling.

CONTEXT:
The comparison PDF currently has large empty whitespace at the bottom. We want to use that space to add a simple grading legend that explains what A–F means, making the PDF feel more like an investor report and reducing confusion when shared.

GOALS:
- Add a compact “Grade Guide” table near the bottom of the PDF.
- Keep it subtle: smaller font than main table, light borders, light header background.
- Reinforce that grades are based on Net Yield (Asset) only (for clarity and legal safety).
- Must not break pagination or push content off the page.
- Must render correctly in light-mode PDF output (PDF should always be light even if UI is dark mode).

WHERE TO ADD:
- Deal Comparison PDF (the table-style PDF export).
- Place the Grade Guide below the main results table and disclaimer, but above the footer/version area if possible.
- If there isn’t enough space on the first page, put it at the top of page 2 (still compact), but prefer page 1 if it fits.

CONTENT:
Title: “Grade Guide”
Small helper line under title (optional but recommended):
“Grades are calculated automatically using Net Yield (Asset) bands.”

Table columns:
| Grade | Meaning | Based On |

Rows:
A | Excellent – strong yield | Net Yield (Asset)
B | Good – solid performance | Net Yield (Asset)
C | Average – acceptable return | Net Yield (Asset)
D | Weak – below target yield | Net Yield (Asset)
E–F | Poor – low return | Net Yield (Asset)

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Font size: ~10–11px (smaller than main table)
- Header row: light grey background (#f3f3f3 or similar)
- Borders: 1px light grey (#ddd)
- Padding: small (6–8px)
- Width: ~85–90% of page, centred
- Rounded corners optional (keep subtle)
- Must look professional, not like a “web table dumped into PDF”

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Identify the function that generates the Deal Comparison PDF (likely in public/app.js).
- Inject this section into the PDF HTML before rendering to canvas/pdf.
- Ensure it appears only in the PDF export (not on-screen UI).
- Ensure PDF output is forced into light mode (already done elsewhere — keep consistent).

QA:
- Export a Deal Comparison PDF with 8–10 deals and confirm:
  - Table fits cleanly on page 1 under the results
  - Doesn’t overlap disclaimer/footer
  - Looks crisp and readable
  - Still works when UI is in dark mode (PDF must remain light)
  - Works when only 2–3 deals exist (still looks fine)

FILES LIKELY TO EDIT:
- public/app.js (PDF generation HTML)
- public/style.css (PDF-specific styling if needed)

DO NOT:
- Change any calculations
- Change ranking/sorting logic
- Add any new dependencies unless required (should not be required)
