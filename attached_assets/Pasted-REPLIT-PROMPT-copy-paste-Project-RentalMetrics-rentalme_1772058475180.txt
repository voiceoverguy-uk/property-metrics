REPLIT PROMPT (copy/paste)

Project: RentalMetrics (rentalmetrics.co.uk)

Goal:
Update ONLY the marketing/landing copy on the Deal Calculator page to sound more “investor-grade”.
Do NOT change any calculations, logic, routing, schema structure, layout, spacing, or CSS.
This is a copy refresh only.

Scope:
- Deal Calculator / Deal Analyser landing / underfold section copy
- “Deep dive…” heading + intro paragraph
- 3 cards: “What this calculator covers”, “Who it’s for”, “Why not just use Excel?”
- Optional: tighten the Privacy/Disclaimer wording if those strings are in the same underfold copy area

Hard rules:
- Do NOT rename buttons, modes, or URLs
- Do NOT touch SDLT Calculator route
- Do NOT adjust FAQ data structure (only wording if needed)
- No visual changes. Only text replacements.

COPY UPDATES (replace existing text with the following)
────────────────────────────────────────

1) Replace the underfold H2 heading:
OLD: “Deep dive your next buy-to-let deal”
NEW: “Model your next buy-to-let deal properly”

2) Replace the underfold intro paragraph (the paragraph directly under that H2):
NEW PARAGRAPH:
“This tool goes beyond a basic yield check. It calculates your full acquisition cost — including SDLT and fees — stress-tests your mortgage against rising rates, and shows cash-on-cash return so you know what your actual cash investment is earning. Built for UK landlords and completely free — just enter the numbers and let the model do the work.”

3) Update the card: “Who it’s for” (keep the title the same, just replace bullet text)
NEW BULLETS:
• Landlords using mortgages
• Investors comparing multiple deals
• Buyers checking rent covers rising rates
• Anyone who wants structured analysis without spreadsheet risk

4) Update the card: “Why not just use Excel?” (replace paragraph text)
NEW PARAGRAPH:
“Spreadsheets are flexible — but one wrong formula can distort your entire analysis. This tool applies consistent UK SDLT rules, automates mortgage stress testing, and gives you a standardised deal rating every time — so you can compare properties properly without worrying about formula errors.”

5) OPTIONAL (only if there is a Privacy line in the same underfold section and it currently mentions tracking):
Replace the privacy wording with:
“All calculations run locally in your browser. RentalMetrics does not track you or collect personal data. No property details, addresses, or financial figures are transmitted.”

If you cannot find an exact match, do not guess. Leave it unchanged.

Implementation notes
────────────────────────────────────────
- Make changes in the source of truth for this landing/underfold copy (likely index.html or app.js template strings).
- Keep punctuation exactly (en dash/em dash) so it reads well.
- After edits: refresh the page and confirm no layout shift and no console errors.
- Confirm the SDLT Calculator page is unchanged.

Output:
Reply with the files changed and confirm “copy-only update” completed.
