Project: RentalMetrics
Goal: Add (1) faint branding watermark to PDF exports and (2) subtle success animation when the Deal Snapshot updates/turns “good”.

✅ Requirements

(1) PDF Export: Add faint watermark

What to add
	•	When exporting a PDF (both Deal PDF and Comparison PDF if applicable), add a faint RentalMetrics icon watermark behind the content.
	•	Use the existing house icon asset already used on-page (or the RentalMetrics icon file currently in /public). If the exact icon file isn’t easy to reuse, use any existing icon already referenced in the app so we don’t add new assets.

Behaviour
	•	Watermark should be:
	•	centred on the page
	•	large (roughly 50–70% of page width)
	•	very low opacity (approx 6–12%)
	•	behind all text (must not obscure figures)
	•	Apply watermark to every page if PDF is multi-page.
	•	Must work in both light/dark modes (since it’s the watermark on the PDF, keep it neutral/faint).

Implementation guidance
	•	Find the PDF export code path (likely in public/app.js where “Save as PDF” is handled).
	•	If PDF export is generated from DOM screenshot (e.g., html2canvas):
	•	easiest approach: temporarily inject a watermark element into the export container, export, then remove it.
	•	If PDF export uses a PDF library (e.g., jsPDF):
	•	add the image as a background layer for each page before adding text/image content.
	•	Keep it robust: if watermark image fails to load, export should still succeed with no errors.

Acceptance
	•	PDF exports still work exactly as before.
	•	Watermark is visible but subtle.
	•	No console errors.

(2) Deal Snapshot: subtle success animation

What to add
	•	When the Deal Snapshot updates after calculations (Analyse Deal or Re-analyse) and produces a result, add a small pulse/glow animation to draw the eye.

Rules (important)
	•	Trigger animation:
	•	once when a new result is rendered (after Analyse/Re-analyse)
	•	not continuously while typing in inputs
	•	If you can detect state: only “success” pulse when the snapshot is in a “meets target / above target” state (green/positive), otherwise use a neutral pulse (or no pulse).
	•	Keep it subtle and quick:
	•	duration ~250–450ms
	•	scale 1.00 → 1.01 → 1.00 OR a soft box-shadow glow that fades
	•	Must not cause layout shift.

Implementation guidance
	•	Add a CSS animation class (e.g. .snapshot-pulse and optionally .snapshot-pulse-success)
	•	In JS, after snapshot render completes, add the class to the snapshot container, then remove it after animation ends.
	•	Ensure it doesn’t spam: gate with a short debounce or compare a “lastSnapshotHash/lastCalculatedAt” timestamp so it only runs on result updates.

Acceptance
	•	After Analyse Deal (and Re-analyse), the snapshot animates subtly.
	•	No animation spam while typing.
	•	No console errors.

Files to check/change
	•	public/app.js (PDF export + snapshot render)
	•	public/style.css (animation + any watermark helper style if using DOM injection)
	•	Any PDF helper file used currently (if present)

Notes / Constraints
	•	Do NOT introduce paid APIs.
	•	Do NOT add heavy dependencies.
	•	Keep everything lightweight and stable.
