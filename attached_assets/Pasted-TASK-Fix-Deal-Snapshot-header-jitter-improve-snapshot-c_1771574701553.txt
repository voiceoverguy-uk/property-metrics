TASK: Fix Deal Snapshot header jitter + improve snapshot capture branding (v2.6 polish)

CONTEXT
- Deal Snapshot card now includes a subtle RentalMetrics logo in the header so html2canvas captures it.
- Two issues:
  1) In dark mode, exported PNG shows the logo too dark/muddy.
  2) The logo repositions/jitters on every keystroke (likely due to header DOM being rebuilt on each render/update).
- Also consider a cleaner header layout: logo on top-right, capture button beneath it.

GOALS
- Snapshot header must be visually stable (no shifting) while typing in any input.
- Exported PNG must look clean in BOTH light and dark mode:
  - White background export
  - Subtle logo watermark (not too dark)
- Improve header layout so it looks intentional and reduces horizontal squeeze.
- No calculation changes.

FILES (expected)
- public/app.js
- public/style.css
- public/index.html (only if needed for html2canvas script include)
- replit.md (optional note)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
1) STOP THE LOGO MOVING (DOM STABILITY)
PROBLEM
- Header/logo likely gets re-rendered or re-inserted on every input update.

FIX
- Ensure the snapshot header elements are created ONCE (static DOM), not rebuilt each render.
- If current code uses innerHTML to rebuild the entire snapshot card, refactor so:
  - Header stays untouched after initial mount
  - Only metric text values update (e.g. update spans for numbers)
- Give the logo a fixed container size so layout cannot “breathe”:
  - width: clamp(160px, 18vw, 260px) OR a fixed width on desktop like 240px
  - height locked (e.g. 40px)
  - object-fit: contain
- Add CSS to prevent flex reflow:
  - header uses grid or flex with fixed columns
  - logo container has flex: 0 0 auto

ACCEPTANCE
- Typing in ANY input does not shift the logo or header alignment at all.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2) IMPROVE HEADER LAYOUT (MORE DELIBERATE)
CHANGE
- Update snapshot header layout to:

Row 1:
  Left:  “Deal Snapshot” (title)
  Right: subtle RentalMetrics logo (watermark style)

Row 2:
  Right aligned: “Capture Snapshot” button

DETAILS
- Use CSS grid for the header:
  - grid-template-columns: 1fr auto;
  - grid-template-rows: auto auto;
- Place title in row 1 col 1.
- Place logo in row 1 col 2.
- Place capture button in row 2 col 2 (right aligned).
- Keep everything vertically aligned and consistent across breakpoints.

ACCEPTANCE
- Button no longer competes horizontally with the logo.
- Header looks tidy on desktop AND mobile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
3) DARK MODE EXPORT: MAKE LOGO LOOK RIGHT IN PNG
PROBLEM
- In dark mode export, logo appears too dark.

FIX (CAPTURE-ONLY STYLING)
- During capture only, temporarily apply a “capture-safe” class to the snapshot card (or specifically the logo):
  Example: add class `.is-capturing` to snapshot root while html2canvas runs.
- In CSS for `.is-capturing`:
  - Force white background on the snapshot capture area (if not already).
  - Force the logo to a predictable style:
      filter: grayscale(1) !important;
      opacity: 0.12–0.18 !important;
      (IMPORTANT) disable invert() or any dark-mode-only filter during capture.
- After capture completes (success or failure), remove `.is-capturing`.

ACCEPTANCE
- Exported PNG looks clean in dark mode:
  - Logo is subtle, not heavy/dark
  - No weird invert artefacts
  - PNG is consistent with light mode exports

-------------------------------------------------------------------
4) TOOLTIP TEXT (SMALL POLISH)
- Keep tooltip as: “Download snapshot (PNG)”
- Ensure tooltip still works after header refactor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
5) QA CHECKLIST
- Verify:
  - No layout shift during typing (logo/button stable)
  - Capture works on desktop + mobile
  - Light mode export looks good
  - Dark mode export looks good (logo subtle)
  - No double-branding (no post-canvas drawing code)
  - No logic/calculation changes

OUTPUT
- Commit changes and briefly list files modified.
