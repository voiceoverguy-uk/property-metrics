Build a UK Property Investor Deal Analyser web app (England & Northern Ireland SDLT only for v1).

GOAL
A simple, professional web tool where I enter:
- Address or postcode (string)
- Asking price (£)
- Expected monthly rent (£)
- Solicitor fees (£) (default 1500)
- Refurb/repairs budget (£) (default 0)
- Other costs (£) (default 0)
Optional toggles:
- Buyer type: Investor (additional property) vs First-time buyer
- Show both scenarios side-by-side

The app should calculate:
1) SDLT (Stamp Duty Land Tax) for:
   A) First-time buyer (FTB relief rules)
   B) Investor / additional property (higher rates)
2) Total acquisition cost:
   total = price + sdlt + solicitorFees + refurbCosts + otherCosts
3) Annual rent = monthlyRent * 12
4) Gross yield (%) = annualRent / total * 100
5) Net yield (%) with optional inputs:
   - void months per year (default 0)
   - monthly running costs (default 0)
   netAnnualRent = annualRent - (monthlyRent * voidMonths) - (runningCosts * 12)
   netYield (%) = netAnnualRent / total * 100

Also include a “Target Offer Price” feature:
- User enters target yield % (default 7.0)
- The app outputs the maximum purchase price that would hit that yield (for both Investor and FTB scenarios)
- Implement an iterative approach because SDLT depends on the purchase price:
  - Start with guess = asking price
  - Calculate sdlt for that guess
  - Compute implied maxPurchasePrice = (netAnnualRent / (targetYield/100)) - (sdlt + fees + refurb + other)
  - Repeat up to 10 iterations or until change < £50
- Show suggested offer price clearly with a short note: “To hit X% yield you’d need to pay around £Y”.

SCOPE & SAFETY
- V1 is calculation-first: do not build complex school/Ofsted features yet.
- Do not include Scotland (LBTT) or Wales (LTT).
- Use clean code, clear functions, and input validation.
- Currency is GBP and formatting should use £ with commas.
- Add a clear disclaimer: estimates only, not financial advice; SDLT rules can change.

TECH / STRUCTURE
- Convert the project to an Express server.
- Serve a simple frontend (plain HTML + CSS + client-side JS) from /public.
- Use a single page UI:
  - Input panel
  - Results panel
- Keep SDLT logic in /src/sdlt.js and calculation logic in /src/calcs.js
- Create /public/app.js to handle form input and update results dynamically (no page refresh).

UI REQUIREMENTS
- Clean, modern layout.
- Results should include:
  - SDLT amount
  - Total cost breakdown (price, sdlt, fees, refurb, other)
  - Gross yield and net yield
  - Target Offer Price
- Add small helper tooltips for each input.

DELIVERABLES
- Working app on Replit with a clear README.
- Include a few test examples in README (e.g. £200k, £900 rent, fees £1500).
