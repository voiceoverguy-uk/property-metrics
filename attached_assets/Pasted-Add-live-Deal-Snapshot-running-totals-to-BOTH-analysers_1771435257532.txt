Add live “Deal Snapshot” running totals to BOTH analysers:
1) Simple Analyser
2) Deal Analyser (Advanced)

IMPORTANT LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Desktop/tablet (>= 992px): show the Deal Snapshot inside the EXISTING right-hand results panel (the panel that shows results after pressing Analyse).
  - It should be visible even before Analyse is clicked (in an “as you type” state).
  - Keep it “sticky” within that right panel so it stays visible while scrolling the left form.
  - Do NOT add a floating bottom bar on desktop.

- Mobile (< 992px): show a compact sticky bottom bar (fixed to bottom of viewport).
  - Bar should be collapsible/expandable (e.g. “Show details”).
  - Add bottom padding to the page content so the bar doesn’t cover the Analyse button or last fields.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
A) Deal Snapshot should update LIVE as the user types (no need to press Analyse).

B) Show TWO key outputs:
1) Upfront Total (£)
2) Monthly Cashflow (£/mo)

C) Use progressive calculations consistent with existing Analyse logic. Do not duplicate logic; create shared helper functions used by both analysers and the final Analyse output.

WHAT TO INCLUDE IN CALCULATIONS (by mode):

1) SIMPLE ANALYSER:
Upfront Total should include:
- SDLT (from asking price + buyer type)
- Solicitor Fees (if present in simple; if not present, omit)
- Total Additional Costs (from additional costs list)
- Deposit (ONLY if Mortgage is selected; using deposit £/% input)
Monthly Cashflow should include:
- Expected Monthly Rent
- Letting Agent Fee (rent * fee %, incl VAT toggle)
- Total Recurring Monthly Costs
- Mortgage payment (ONLY if Mortgage is selected; using selected mortgage type)

2) DEAL ANALYSER (ADVANCED):
Include everything from Simple, PLUS apply any relevant yield adjustments that affect monthly rent if they exist in the Deal Analyser:
- Void Allowance (%) should reduce rent accordingly (rent * (1 - void%/100))
- Maintenance Allowance should reduce monthly cashflow (if % of rent or £/year convert to £/mo)
Only include these if they are already part of the deal analyser model. If not available, ignore.

VALIDATION UX:
- If required fields are missing (Address/Postcode, Asking Price, Expected Monthly Rent), snapshot should show a “Missing required fields” warning and list which ones.
- Clicking the warning should scroll to the first missing required field with correct sticky-header offset (use the custom scroll logic already added).

DISPLAY / UI:
- On desktop right panel: show snapshot as a neat card at the top of the results panel:
  Title: “Deal Snapshot”
  Lines:
   - Upfront Total: £X
   - Monthly Cashflow: £Y/mo
  Optional small breakdown below (collapsed by default):
   Deposit, SDLT, Solicitor, Additional, Recurring, Agent fee, Mortgage

- On mobile bottom bar: show two-line compact view:
  “Upfront: £X” and “Cashflow: £Y/mo”
  Tap expands to show the breakdown.

FORM UX TWEAK:
- Move “Expected Monthly Rent (£)” into the same section row/group as “Letting Agent Fee (%)” (wherever feasible) in BOTH analysers for better flow.
  - Keep tooltips and styling consistent.
  - On mobile they can stack but remain in the same grouped section.

Acceptance tests:
- Enter asking price and buyer type -> SDLT updates immediately and upfront total updates.
- Enter rent + agent fee -> cashflow updates immediately.
- Toggle mortgage on/off -> deposit and mortgage payment inclusion updates.
- Mobile: sticky bar never hides Analyse button (page has enough bottom padding).
