Copy/paste this:

TASK: Add explicit ordering indicator to Comparison History to remove ambiguity and make it feel like a proper investor scoreboard.

CONTEXT
- Comparison History currently shows deals in a fixed order.
- There is no visible explanation of how the list is ordered.
- This can confuse users (is it recent? best? selected?).

GOAL
Add a subtle, non-intrusive line under the “Comparison History” heading:

    Sorted by: Net Yield (Asset) · Highest first

This should feel intentional, clean, and professional — not cluttered.

------------------------------------------------------------
1) UI ADDITION

A) Under the "Comparison History" title (but above the first row),
   add a small grey meta line:

   Sorted by: Net Yield (Asset) · Highest first

B) Style requirements:
   - Smaller font than the heading (approx 0.85–0.9rem).
   - Medium-light grey (consistent with other helper text).
   - No heavy emphasis.
   - On mobile, it should wrap naturally if needed.
   - Spacing: small margin-top under heading, small margin-bottom before rows.

C) Placement:
   Layout should be:

   Comparison History        [Compare Deals]   [Clear All]
   Sorted by: Net Yield (Asset) · Highest first
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   [row 1]
   [row 2]

------------------------------------------------------------
2) LOGIC RULE

For now, this is STATIC text:

- Always display:
  "Sorted by: Net Yield (Asset) · Highest first"

We are NOT adding sort controls yet.
We are NOT changing ordering logic.
This is a clarity/UX improvement only.

------------------------------------------------------------
3) FUTURE-PROOFING (Optional, but structure cleanly)

Wrap the text in a container that could later be replaced with a dynamic sort control.
Example:

<div class="history-meta">
  Sorted by: Net Yield (Asset) · Highest first
</div>

So in future we can convert this to:
"Sort: Deal Rating ▼" etc.

------------------------------------------------------------
4) QUALITY CHECK

After implementation, verify:
- Desktop layout remains aligned.
- Mobile does not look cramped.
- Compare Deals button alignment remains unchanged.
- No calculation logic modified.

DELIVERABLE
- Clean UI update only.
- No version bump required (this is a minor clarity addition).
