TASK: Add “landing content under the fold” ONLY on the homepage route / (Simple Analyser). Do NOT show this section on /deal-analyser or /sdlt-calculator.

Goal: Friendly “DIY landlord helper” vibe (professional, but not corporate). Keep the page clean and uncluttered.

Design rules (non-negotiable):
	•	Must match existing layout width/container and spacing.
	•	Use existing brand red #d42027 only as small accents (thin divider line, small icon accents, button outline). No big red blocks.
	•	Desktop: simple, airy 2-column layout with two cards only.
	•	Mobile: single column.
	•	Only one H2.
	•	Bullets: max 6.
	•	FAQ must be an accordion with answers collapsed by default.
	•	Keep disclaimer to one short paragraph.

Mobile Show/Hide toggle (important):
	•	On screens <= 768px, the entire under-fold section should be collapsed by default and replaced with a single button:
“Show calculator help” (outline style, #d42027).
	•	When tapped, expand the whole section and change button text to:
“Hide calculator help”
	•	The expand/collapse should be smooth (CSS transition), and should not jump the page around.
	•	On desktop, the section is always visible (no toggle).

Content structure (homepage only):
	1.	H2: “UK buy-to-let maths, without the headache.”
	2.	Intro (2–3 sentences): explain RentalMetrics gives quick GBP estimates for yield, costs, and cash flow using common UK assumptions. Keep it calm and friendly.
	3.	Two cards side-by-side (desktop) / stacked (mobile):
	•	Card A (H3): “What you can calculate”
Bullets (max 6): Gross yield, net yield, monthly cash flow, cash-on-cash return, mortgage stress test, SDLT estimate, PDF export (pick best 6).
	•	Card B (H3): “How it works”
Steps (3 lines): 1) Enter price + rent 2) Add costs (and mortgage if needed) 3) Get results + export PDF
	4.	FAQ accordion (use these 4 Qs + ~40–70 word answers):
	•	What’s the difference between gross and net yield?
	•	What costs should landlords include in “net yield”?
	•	What is a “stress test rate” and why does it matter?
	•	What’s considered a “good” rental yield in the UK?
	5.	Disclaimer (1 short paragraph): estimates only, not financial/tax advice, figures depend on real costs and lender terms.
	6.	Single community link line (no API, no event feed):
Text: “Leeds Property Investor Group on Meetup”
Link URL: https://www.meetup.com/leeds-property-people/

Technical:
	•	Ensure this section is in the DOM on / immediately (not lazy inserted after load).
	•	Keep performance fast: no new libraries.
	•	Keep existing SEO + schema unchanged except if you need to add IDs/classes for styling and the mobile toggle.
