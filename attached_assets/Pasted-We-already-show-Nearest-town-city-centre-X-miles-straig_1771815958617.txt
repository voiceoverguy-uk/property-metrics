We already show “Nearest (town/city) centre — X miles (straight-line)” under the map. Please enhance this section with the following changes, keeping it FREE (no Google Places API / no paid endpoints):

1) Tighten the wording + formatting

Change the line to this exact style:

🟡 Short drive · Wakefield centre — 1.5 miles (straight-line)

Rules:
	•	Use the yellow dot emoji at the start.
	•	Use a middle dot separator · between the label and the location name.
	•	Replace “city centre” / “town centre” wording with “[Place] centre” to avoid debates.
	•	Keep “(straight-line)” at the end.

2) Add a small tooltip explaining the distance type

Add a small ? tooltip icon next to the “Short drive” label (or at the end of the line) with tooltip text:

“Distance band is based on straight-line mileage (not driving time).”

Must work on:
	•	Hover (desktop)
	•	Tap (mobile)

Match the existing tooltip styling used elsewhere in the app.

3) Add “Nearest train station” (FREE approach)

Under the centre-distance line, add a second line:

🚆 Nearest train station · [Station Name] — X miles (straight-line)

Constraints:
	•	Do NOT use Google Places API.
	•	Use only what we already have available for free (geocoding results + our existing map/geo logic).
	•	Use a small built-in dataset/list of UK train stations (name + lat/lng) OR a limited regional subset (e.g., England/Wales) stored locally in the project.
	•	Find the nearest station to the property lat/lng using Haversine distance.
	•	Display the closest result with miles to 1 decimal place.

UX/behaviour:
	•	Only show this line once we have valid property coordinates.
	•	If no station dataset is available or no match is found, hide the line silently (no error message).
	•	Keep styling consistent with the existing “Nearest centre” line (same container, subtle, clean).

4) Keep exports clean

This section should appear on-screen, but:
	•	Must not break PDF layout.
	•	If we’re currently using .no-export / body.is-exporting, follow the same export rules so it behaves consistently.

5) Files

Implement cleanly in the existing structure:
	•	Update JS logic where the centre-distance is calculated/rendered.
	•	Add a new local data file if needed, e.g. /public/data/uk-train-stations.json (or similar).
	•	Add minimal CSS if required.

After implementing, test with at least 3 addresses:
	•	A city centre property
	•	A suburban property
	•	A rural property

Confirm the output shows both lines and tooltip works on mobile + desktop.
