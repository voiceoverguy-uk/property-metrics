Goal
We want to simplify the product navigation and reduce user confusion by removing “Simple Analyser” mode entirely.
Going forward the site has ONLY two modes:
1) Deal Calculator (the current Deal Analyser)
2) SDLT Calculator Only (unchanged)

We are NOT criticising existing work — the Deal Analyser already supports “simple” usage by leaving advanced fields blank. This change is purely to streamline the UI and routing.

What to change (high level)
A) Remove the “Simple Analyser” tab/button from the UI.
B) Remove the “simple-mode” route/state so users can’t access it.
C) Ensure any old links / stored state / history entries that reference simple-mode are gracefully redirected to Deal Calculator.
D) Update the hero heading + description on Deal Calculator to explain it can be quick OR detailed (Option B copy below).
E) Keep SDLT Calculator Only exactly as-is.

Copy requirements (Option B)
Update the Deal page header section to:

H1:
Buy-to-Let Deal Calculator (UK)

Subheading:
Analyse your buy-to-let deal in seconds — or go deeper. Enter price and rent for instant yield. Add costs, voids and mortgage stress testing for full modelling.

Implementation details (please follow)
1) UI / Navigation
- Remove the “Simple Analyser” button/tab completely from the top nav.
- Ensure the remaining tabs are:
  - Deal Calculator (default / primary)
  - SDLT Calculator Only
- If there is any label “Deal Analyser”, rename it to “Deal Calculator”.

2) Mode handling / Routing
- Remove any code paths for “simple” mode:
  - any setMode("simple") / body class "simple-mode" / isSimpleMode flags, etc.
- The default landing mode should be Deal Calculator.

3) Backwards compatibility (important)
- If localStorage, query params, or saved history items contain a mode of "simple" (or equivalent),
  then:
  - silently map it to "deal" (Deal Calculator)
  - do not throw errors
  - do not show warnings
- If there is a URL route like /simple-analyser (or similar), redirect it to /deal-analyser (or your current deal route).
- If there is a “Simple” item in any internal menu or logic, remove it.

4) Keep the functionality
- Do NOT remove any fields/sections from the Deal Calculator.
- The “simple experience” is achieved by users leaving optional sections blank.
- Snapshot should still update live as inputs are entered.

5) Files & checks
- Make the minimum necessary edits across:
  - public/index.html (or wherever nav lives)
  - public/app.js (mode switching, history restore, routing)
  - public/style.css (remove/harden any simple-mode styling)
  - replit.md (update documentation if it mentions Simple Analyser)
- After changes:
  - Verify Deal Calculator loads and functions normally
  - Verify SDLT Calculator Only still works
  - Verify no console errors
  - Verify any old “simple” state gracefully opens Deal Calculator

Deliverable
Implement the above, test quickly in desktop + mobile widths, and confirm:
- Only 2 choices remain (Deal Calculator / SDLT Calculator)
- Old “simple” references redirect safely to Deal Calculator
- Copy is updated to Option B
