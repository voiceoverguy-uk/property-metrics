You are working on the RentalMetrics web app (UK buy-to-let tool). Please implement the following across BOTH Simple mode and Advanced/Deal Analyser mode.

1) SIMPLE MODE: Add “Recurring Monthly Costs”
- Add a section titled exactly: “Recurring Monthly Costs”
- UI: repeatable rows with two inputs:
  - left: cost name placeholder “e.g. Insurance”
  - right: monthly amount in GBP, placeholder “£0”
  - include remove row button (x) per row
  - include “+ Add Recurring Cost” button
- Show a live total line: “Total Recurring Monthly Costs: £X/mo”
- Persist these costs in the same app state as the advanced version (shared model), so switching between Simple and Advanced does not lose values.

2) RENAME: Wherever “Monthly Running Costs” exists, rename to “Recurring Monthly Costs” (label text only; keep any underlying variable names if needed).

3) DEPOSIT INPUT UX (Simple + Advanced Mortgage sections)
Replace the current single “Deposit (£)” input with:
- A single input field plus a small toggle to choose input type: “£” or “%”
- When toggle is “£”: user types deposit in pounds; automatically compute deposit percentage based on purchase price.
- When toggle is “%”: user types deposit percentage; automatically compute deposit pounds.
- Display the computed counterpart below the field as helper text, e.g.:
  - If input is £: “That’s 15.0% deposit”
  - If input is %: “That’s £30,000 deposit”
- Validation:
  - Clamp % to 0–100
  - Deposit £ cannot exceed purchase price; if it does, set deposit £ = purchase price
  - Prevent NaN; empty input should behave sensibly (treat as 0)
- Ensure mortgage loan amount updates live: loan = purchasePrice - deposit£

4) FINANCE IN RESULTS (Add suggestion #5)
When Purchase Type is Mortgage, include finance in the analysis outputs:
- Calculate monthly mortgage payment at minimum using interest-only:
  monthlyMortgagePayment = (loanAmount * (interestRate/100)) / 12
- Incorporate this into deal results:
  - Show “Monthly Mortgage Payment: £X/mo”
  - Show “Cashflow After Mortgage: £(monthlyRent - recurringMonthlyCosts - lettingAgentFee - monthlyMortgagePayment)/mo”
  - Ensure recurringMonthlyCosts are included in this calculation
- Keep existing calculations intact; just add these new outputs and ensure they update when inputs change.

General requirements:
- GBP formatting with £ and 2 decimals where appropriate.
- Keep the UI styling consistent with existing components.
- No breaking changes, no loss of existing saved values.
- If there are separate state slices for simple vs advanced, unify them so both read/write the same fields.
- After implementing, verify both Simple and Advanced pages show the same recurring costs and deposit values when toggling between modes.
