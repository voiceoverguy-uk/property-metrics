TASK: Final polish round before release.
Add branding (logo) to Snapshot PNG + Comparison PDF, add ROI Rank toggle and Benchmark feature.
REMOVE any Share Snapshot link/copy functionality (not needed).

NO calculation logic changes.

VERSION:
Bump to Version 2.6 — February 2026
Update footer and PDF footer.

------------------------------------------------------------
A) SNAPSHOT PNG — ADD LOGO OVERLAY
Goal:
Include RentalMetrics branding inside exported snapshot image.

Logo file to use:
"/public/rental-metrics-logo-primary-2400x240.png"

Implementation:
After html2canvas creates the canvas:
- Create new Image()
- src = "/rental-metrics-logo-primary-2400x240.png"
- When loaded:
    draw logo onto canvas context
    position: bottom-right
    padding: 24px
    max display width: 180px (scale proportionally)
    opacity: 0.9

Do NOT distort logo.
Ensure export scale remains >= 2 for crisp text.
White background only.

Do not show this logo in normal UI — only inside exported PNG.

------------------------------------------------------------
B) PDF — ADD LOGO IN HEADER
Logo file:
"/public/rental-metrics-logo-primary-1200x120.png"

Placement:
Top-right of first page header.
Small and clean (approx 35–45mm wide equivalent depending on PDF library scale).
Keep spacing so it does not overlap title.

Footer remains:
RentalMetrics v2.6 - February 2026

------------------------------------------------------------
C) ROI RANK TOGGLE (Scoreboard Mode)
Goal:
Allow user to toggle ranking numbers.

UI:
Near “Comparison History” heading:
Add small toggle switch:
Label: "Show ranks"

Default: OFF.

Behaviour:
When ON:
- Each history row shows rank badge (#1, #2, #3…)
- Ranking based on CURRENT history sort (Net Yield Asset descending)
- Missing yield values rank last
- Stable sort for equal values

Badge styling:
Small grey pill with "#1"
Do not overpower grade circle.
On mobile, display inline next to deal name.

Also apply ranking in Compare modal:
- If sorted by Deal Rating → rank by rating order
- If sorted by Net Yield → rank by yield
- If sorted by Cash-on-Cash → rank by C-o-C
Use same consistent ranking logic.

------------------------------------------------------------
D) BENCHMARK VS YIELD FEATURE
Goal:
User can set their own benchmark yield and see delta.

1) Add small link under Net Yield (Asset) in Deal Snapshot:
"Set benchmark"

When clicked:
Show small inline input:
Benchmark Yield (%) [ number input ]
Save value to localStorage as "rm_benchmark_yield"

2) If benchmark is set:
Display under Net Yield (Asset):

Benchmark: X.X%  (Δ +Y.Y%)

Where:
Δ = NetYieldAsset - Benchmark
Green if positive
Red if negative

3) If no benchmark set:
Do not display anything.

Do NOT hardcode UK average yield.
This is user-defined only.

------------------------------------------------------------
E) CLEANUP & VERIFY
- History list actually sorted by Net Yield (Asset) descending.
- Missing yield rows at bottom.
- Mobile metric wrapping still clean.
- Snapshot export works with logo.
- PDF exports with logo.
- Footer shows Version 2.6 — February 2026.

NO share link.
NO clipboard logic.
NO backend storage.

Deliver clean working implementation.
