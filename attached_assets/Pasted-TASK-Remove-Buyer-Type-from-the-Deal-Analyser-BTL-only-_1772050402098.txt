TASK: Remove “Buyer Type” from the Deal Analyser (BTL-only), lock logic to Investor/Additional Property, and ensure nothing breaks.

CONTEXT
RentalMetrics Deal Analyser is a Buy-to-Let deal tool. “Main Residence” / “First-Time Buyer” options confuse positioning and are not needed in the Deal Analyser. SDLT Calculator Only route can stay as-is (no change required unless needed).

GOALS
1) Deal Analyser: remove the Buyer Type toggle UI entirely.
2) Deal Analyser: always calculate using Investor / Additional Property rules (i.e., additional property SDLT where applicable and all investor assumptions).
3) Ensure existing features still work:
   - Analysis + grade
   - Snapshot + PDF export + comparison PDF
   - History save/recall + comparison modal
   - SDLT breakdown displayed in Deal Analyser (if present)
4) Do not break the separate “SDLT Calculator Only” page/route.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
A) UI removal
- In the Deal Analyser page template (index.html or the Deal Analyser component/section), remove the entire “Buyer Type” block:
  - Label “Buyer Type”
  - 3-way toggle: Main Residence / Investor / First-Time Buyer

B) Lock the underlying state (critical)
- Find the state/variable that stores buyer type, e.g.:
  - buyerType
  - purchaserType
  - isInvestor
  - sdltProfile
  - purchaseProfile
- In the Deal Analyser initialisation, force it to Investor/Additional Property:
  - buyerType = "investor"
  - and/or sdltMode = "additional_property"
- Do this in ONE central place that runs:
  1) on page load
  2) on “Start Again”
  3) when loading a deal from History
- If there is a persisted value in localStorage/history that includes buyerType:
  - Ignore it for Deal Analyser (override it to investor)
  - BUT do not delete it from stored deals (just don’t use it here)

C) Defensive code cleanup
- Any logic that branches on buyerType should still work, but in Deal Analyser it should always use investor path.
- Remove any event listeners that were tied to the old toggle.
- If the UI removal causes “null element” errors, guard or remove those references.

D) SDLT Calculator Only route
- Leave SDLT Calculator Only route unchanged.
- If it shares components with Deal Analyser, ensure the buyer type selector remains available there ONLY if it currently exists and is intended.

E) Regression checks (must do)
- Run through these flows:
  1) Enter deal -> Analyse Deal -> SDLT breakdown correct for investor additional property
  2) Mortgage + cash modes still calculate correctly
  3) Capture Snapshot / Share / Save as PDF works
  4) Comparison history save -> open history -> recall -> map loads -> analysis still investor rules
  5) Comparison modal -> Download PDF works
- Confirm no console errors.

OUTPUT
- Provide a summary of files changed and confirm Deal Analyser now always runs as Investor / Additional Property with no Buyer Type toggle shown.
