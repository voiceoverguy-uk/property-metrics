Goal: Enhance RentalMetrics (plain CSS project) by adding 8 practical investor features + clear tooltips, without cluttering the UI. Keep it mobile-friendly and consistent with the current design.

Constraints:
	•	No Tailwind. Use existing styles in public/style.css.
	•	Preserve current layout/flow. Add new inputs in logical sections with clean spacing.
	•	All currency in GBP (£). UK wording/spelling.
	•	Add sensible defaults.
	•	Make calculations update correctly in the Deal Analysis results and PDF export (if PDF is currently generated from the same data).
	•	Add tooltips (small “?” icons) explaining key metrics and new inputs.

⸻

1) Void / Vacancy Allowance (%)

Add a new input in the “Yield Adjustments” area:
	•	Label: Void Allowance (%)
	•	Default: 5
	•	Help tooltip: “Allowance for empty periods. 5% means rent is reduced by 5% across the year.”
	•	Calculation: Effective Annual Rent = Annual Rent × (1 − void%/100)
	•	Use effective annual rent in: gross yield, net yield, cash flow, ROI calculations.

2) Maintenance Allowance (choose %) OR (£/year)

Add a toggle with two modes (radio or segmented):
	•	Maintenance (% of rent) default 8%
	•	Maintenance (£ per year) default £0
Tooltip: “Ongoing repairs/maintenance allowance. Many investors budget 5–10% of rent.”
	•	If % mode: annual maintenance = effective annual rent × (maintenance%/100)
	•	If £ mode: annual maintenance = entered amount
	•	Include this in net annual rent and net yield calculations.

3) Stress Test Interest Rate (%)

In Mortgage section, add:
	•	Label: Stress Test Rate (%)
	•	Default: 7.0
	•	Add a “Run Stress Test” button or auto-calc toggle.

	•	Monthly cash flow at stress rate
	•	“Cash Flow Positive/Negative at Stress Rate” badge
Tooltip: “Checks affordability if rates rise (e.g. 7%).”
