We now have 3 routes: / , /deal-analyser , /sdlt-calculator.

Please implement proper per-route SEO meta for social sharing and indexing.

1) Canonical tags (MUST):
- / -> <link rel="canonical" href="https://rentalmetrics.co.uk/">
- /deal-analyser -> <link rel="canonical" href="https://rentalmetrics.co.uk/deal-analyser">
- /sdlt-calculator -> <link rel="canonical" href="https://rentalmetrics.co.uk/sdlt-calculator">

2) Open Graph + Twitter tags (per route):
Ensure the initial HTML served for each route contains correct OG/Twitter tags (server-side), not only injected via client JS.

For each route set:
- og:title
- og:description
- og:url
- og:type = website
- og:image (use the existing OG image for all routes for now)
- twitter:card = summary_large_image
- twitter:title
- twitter:description
- twitter:image

Use these exact values:

/ 
og:title: "Rental Yield Calculator UK (Free)"
og:description: "Estimate gross and net yield, cash flow and acquisition costs for UK buy-to-let deals in seconds."
og:url: "https://rentalmetrics.co.uk/"

/deal-analyser
og:title: "Buy-to-Let Deal Analyser UK"
og:description: "Stress test rent vs mortgage, model costs and cash-on-cash return, and see if a deal meets your target yield. Free tool."
og:url: "https://rentalmetrics.co.uk/deal-analyser"

/sdlt-calculator
og:title: "Stamp Duty Calculator UK (SDLT)"
og:description: "Free SDLT calculator for investors, additional properties and first-time buyers. Instant estimates using current England rates."
og:url: "https://rentalmetrics.co.uk/sdlt-calculator"

Twitter tags should mirror OG.

3) Keep existing dynamic document.title updates in the SPA, but the server-rendered meta should already be correct on first load for each route.

Files:
- server.js: when serving index.html for each route, inject the correct meta/canonical block for that route (string replace placeholders is fine).
- index.html: add placeholders like %%CANONICAL%%, %%OG_TITLE%%, %%OG_DESC%%, %%OG_URL%%, %%OG_IMAGE%%.

Do not break existing routing or calculator functionality.
