🛠️ VERSION 2.4 – VISUAL & UX POLISH

Please implement the following UI and UX refinements without changing any underlying calculations.

⸻

1️⃣ Deal Snapshot – Visual Hierarchy Upgrade

Rework visual emphasis in the Deal Snapshot card so metrics are clearly prioritised.

New hierarchy:
	1.	Net Yield (Asset) – most prominent metric
	2.	Monthly Cashflow – second most prominent
	3.	Cash-on-Cash
	4.	Upfront Total – slightly reduced emphasis

Changes:
	•	Increase font-size of Net Yield by ~10–15%
	•	Make Net Yield slightly bolder
	•	Keep existing colour logic
	•	Slightly reduce font-weight of Upfront Total so it doesn’t compete visually
	•	Maintain responsive layout

Goal: Yield visually anchors the decision logic.

⸻

2️⃣ History Row – Improve Monthly Cashflow Visibility

In Comparison History rows:

Current format:
£200k · Yield 6.0% · +£993/mo

Update:
	•	Increase monthly cashflow font-weight (600 or 700)
	•	Slightly increase font-size by 1px if currently small
	•	Keep green/red colour coding
	•	Do NOT bold the entire line

Goal: Make cashflow the eye-catching number during quick scanning.

⸻

3️⃣ Grading Clarification Line

Under the grade label (e.g. “Excellent”), add small grey helper text:

Rating based on Net Yield (Asset) only.

Requirements:
	•	Subtle grey colour
	•	Smaller font-size than grade label
	•	Display in compare modal and PDF export
	•	Do not clutter layout

Goal: Avoid confusion about what grading represents.

⸻

4️⃣ BEST DEAL Badge – Mobile Optimisation

Prevent “BEST DEAL” from awkwardly wrapping into two chunky lines on mobile.

Adjust:
	•	Slightly reduce horizontal padding
	•	Slightly reduce vertical padding if needed
	•	Ensure badge remains readable
	•	Keep consistent styling

Goal: Cleaner mobile presentation.

⸻

5️⃣ Auto-Generated Deal Naming Logic

If Deal Reference field is empty, auto-generate a display name using this priority:
	1.	Use Address/Postcode if available
	2.	Else use: “£{Asking Price} Deal”
	3.	Else fallback to: “Untitled Deal”

Do not overwrite stored reference — this is display logic only.

Apply to:
	•	Comparison History
	•	Compare Modal
	•	PDF export

Goal: Remove generic “Untitled Deal” where avoidable.

⸻

6️⃣ Quality Check

Verify:
	•	Sorting still works correctly
	•	BEST DEAL logic unchanged (still based on highest Net Yield)
	•	No layout breakage on mobile
	•	No metric overlap or overflow
