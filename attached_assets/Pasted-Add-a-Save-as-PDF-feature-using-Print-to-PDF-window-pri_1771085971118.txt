Add a “Save as PDF” feature using Print-to-PDF (window.print) with a clean print layout.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Add a “Save as PDF” button
- Place it near the “Analyse Deal” button AND also in the results header area (either location is fine, but at least one obvious place).
- Clicking it should open the print dialog via window.print().

2) Create a print-friendly layout (CSS @media print)
- On print/PDF, hide all non-essential UI elements:
  - Analyse Deal button (optional: hide after triggering print)
  - scenario toggle buttons
  - tooltips ( ? icons )
  - add/remove cost item buttons and X delete buttons
  - any debug messages
- Ensure the printed page includes ONLY the essential report content:
  A) Title: “UK Property Deal Report”
  B) Date/time generated (local time)
  C) Address/postcode
  D) Inputs summary:
     - Asking price
     - Expected monthly rent
     - Solicitor fees
     - Void months/year
     - Monthly running costs
     - Itemised additional costs list with totals
  E) Results summary for BOTH scenarios (Investor + First-time buyer):
     - SDLT breakdown table (band, rate, tax)
     - Total SDLT
     - Total acquisition cost
     - Gross yield, Net yield
     - Target yield %
     - Target offer price
- If the user is viewing “Investor only” or “First-time buyer only”, the PDF should still include both scenarios (preferred) OR include only the currently selected view (acceptable). If including both is easy, do both.

3) Print styling rules
- Use a single-column print layout for readability.
- Use black text on white background.
- Remove shadows, rounded-corner “card” styling, and background gradients for print.
- Keep the red (#d42027) only as a small accent (e.g. section headings or a thin divider line), but avoid large red blocks in print.
- Ensure tables don’t split awkwardly across pages:
  - Use page-break-inside: avoid on key sections and tables where possible.
- Set sensible print margins.

4) Implementation details
- Add a print timestamp dynamically in the report.
- Ensure window.print() works reliably and doesn’t require refresh.
- Keep existing calculation logic unchanged.

DELIVERABLE
- Button works
- PDF output is tidy, professional, and includes all key data
