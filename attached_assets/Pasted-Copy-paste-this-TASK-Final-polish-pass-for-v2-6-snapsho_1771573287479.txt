TASK: Final polish pass for v2.6 snapshot + comparison UX (logo in snapshot UI, clearer rank toggle, benchmark helper text). No calculation changes.

GOALS
- Snapshot capture should INCLUDE branding (logo visible inside the snapshot card header).
- Keep PDF logo as-is (already looks good) unless any sizing bug found.
- Make the rank toggle wording match what it really does (shows/hides badges).
- Benchmark UI should clearly state: “Stored in this browser only”.
- Keep everything clean on mobile + dark mode safe.

------------------------------------------------------------
A) SNAPSHOT: ADD SUBTLE LOGO INSIDE THE SNAPSHOT HEADER (DOM)
CURRENT:
- Capture Snapshot exports a PNG; a logo is added AFTER capture in code, so it won’t appear in the UI or in the captured image.

CHANGE TO:
1) Add a small inline logo element inside the Deal Snapshot card header area (the empty space to the right of the title — the “red box” area in my screenshot).
2) This logo must be:
   - visible in the UI (so html2canvas captures it)
   - subtle: low opacity (e.g. 0.15–0.25), grayscale or muted
   - max height ~28–34px (desktop) and ~22–26px (mobile if shown)
   - should not push layout around
3) Use an existing file from /public, preferably:
   - rental-metrics-logo-primary-600x60.png (ideal for header)
   OR rentalmetrics-logo.png if that’s what the header uses already
4) Add CSS that works in light + dark mode:
   - in dark mode, increase opacity slightly if needed (still subtle)
   - ensure it doesn’t become high-contrast or distracting

IMPORTANT:
- Once the logo is in the DOM header, REMOVE the “draw logo onto canvas after capture” step (otherwise we risk double-branding).
- The exported PNG should still be crisp: use html2canvas scale 2 (or devicePixelRatio) as currently.

Acceptance:
- Clicking “Capture Snapshot” produces an image that includes the logo in the header.
- No duplicate logos on the exported PNG.

------------------------------------------------------------
B) CAPTURE BUTTON MICRO-COPY (OPTIONAL, NICE)
- Tooltip currently says “Download snapshot as image”
- Change tooltip to: “Download snapshot (PNG)”
(Keep short.)

------------------------------------------------------------
C) COMPARISON HISTORY: RANK TOGGLE RENAME + CLARITY
CURRENT:
- Toggle says “Show ranks”
- List is already sorted by Net Yield (Asset) so user expects order anyway.

CHANGE TO:
1) Rename toggle label to: “Show rank badges”
2) Add tiny helper text under the “Sorted by …” line (desktop only, very subtle):
   - “Badges reflect the current sort order.”
3) Keep default OFF (unchecked) on load.

Acceptance:
- Toggle only controls badge visibility (#1, #2, #3…)
- Order stays as-is (no sort changes).
- Looks good in dark mode.

------------------------------------------------------------
D) BENCHMARK: ADD “STORED IN THIS BROWSER ONLY”
CURRENT:
- “Set benchmark” appears under Net Yield (Asset) in snapshot.

CHANGE TO:
1) Next to (or under) the benchmark link/input, add helper text:
   - “Stored in this browser only”
   Style: very small, muted grey, not underlined, not clickable.
2) If benchmark is set and showing a delta:
   - also show the helper text (still visible, still subtle)
3) Keep benchmark saved in localStorage as currently (no server calls).

Acceptance:
- Helper text is visible whenever benchmark UI is visible.
- Dark mode contrast is readable but subtle.

------------------------------------------------------------
E) QUICK QA CHECKS (DO NOT SKIP)
- Verify Comparison History is truly sorted by Net Yield (Asset) DESC, with missing yields at bottom.
- Verify nowrap chunks in history rows (cashflow and C-o-C) still never split mid-number.
- Verify snapshot header layout doesn’t shift when logo loads.
- Verify no layout overflow on mobile.

------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION
- Keep v2.6 unless you have already bumped further — if changes require a bump, set to v2.6.1 — February 2026.
- Ensure footer + PDFs match the version displayed in-app.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement changes + confirm which files were modified.
- Provide before/after screenshots for:
  1) Deal Snapshot (with logo visible)
  2) Captured PNG output
  3) Comparison History toggle area
  4) Benchmark helper text
  5) Dark mode snapshot + history
