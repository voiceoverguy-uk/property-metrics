TASK: Add a clear “Sorted by…” indicator to Comparison History + lock the history row metric wrapping on mobile. Also add (desktop-only) Deal Reference under Deal Snapshot, and a “Capture Deal Snapshot” button to export the snapshot card cleanly.

CONTEXT
- App currently has a Comparison History list at the bottom of the Deal Analyser.
- Users can assume it’s sorted by recency, but right now the order is not obvious.
- On mobile, the history row metrics sometimes wrap awkwardly (e.g., “+” on one line and “£574/mo” on the next).
- Desktop Deal Snapshot would benefit from showing the Deal Reference underneath the heading.
- Users want a one-click way to export/share just the Deal Snapshot card (no surrounding UI).

------------------------------------------------------------
1) COMPARISON HISTORY: SHOW SORT EXPLANATION
GOAL:
Make the order self-explanatory with one calm line under the “Comparison History” heading.

CHANGE:
- Under “Comparison History” title (and above the first history row), add:
  “Sorted by: Net Yield (Asset) · Highest first”
- Styling:
  - small, subtle grey (same tone you use for helper text elsewhere)
  - margin-top: ~8px
  - margin-bottom: ~12px

DATA/LOGIC:
- Ensure the history list is actually rendered in this order:
  Sort by Net Yield (Asset) descending (highest first)
  - Deals with missing Net Yield go to bottom
  - Stable sort for ties (keep original order if same yield)

------------------------------------------------------------
2) COMPARISON HISTORY: MOBILE WRAP / READABILITY FIX
GOAL:
Stop awkward line breaks in the metric line.

CHANGE:
- In the history row “metrics line” (the small text line with £price · Yield · cashflow · C-o-C):
  - Wrap each “chunk” in spans:
    a) price chunk (e.g., “£200k”)
    b) yield chunk (e.g., “Yield 7.3%”)
    c) cashflow chunk (e.g., “+£574/mo”)
    d) C-o-C chunk (only if mortgage deal) (e.g., “C-o-C 10.4%”)
    e) purchase icon/label chunk (cash/mortgage)

CSS RULES:
- Apply `white-space: nowrap;` to the cashflow chunk span so “+£574/mo” never splits.
- Apply `white-space: nowrap;` to the C-o-C chunk span so “C-o-C 10.4%” never splits.
- Allow wrapping BETWEEN chunks only (so the bullets/dots can wrap cleanly, not mid-number).
- Keep the bullets/dots with spacing consistent on desktop and mobile.

------------------------------------------------------------
3) DEAL SNAPSHOT (DESKTOP): SHOW DEAL REFERENCE
GOAL:
Make the Deal Snapshot self-explanatory when shared.

CHANGE:
- On desktop only (e.g., min-width 992px), under the “Deal Snapshot” heading, add a small line:
  “Deal reference: {dealReference}”
- If dealReference is blank, hide the line entirely.
- Styling: subtle grey, smaller than heading, similar to “helper” typography.

------------------------------------------------------------
4) “CAPTURE DEAL SNAPSHOT” EXPORT BUTTON
GOAL:
User can export JUST the Deal Snapshot card without a full-page screenshot.

UI:
- Add a small secondary button in the Deal Snapshot card header area:
  Label: “Capture Snapshot”
  (Desktop: right-aligned near the card title; Mobile: place below title or as an icon button)

BEHAVIOUR:
- When clicked:
  - Capture only the Deal Snapshot card DOM element (not the whole page)
  - Export as a PNG download (filename format: RentalMetrics-Deal-Snapshot-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm.png)
- Implementation options:
  - Use html2canvas (preferred) or similar lightweight library
  - Ensure the capture includes:
    - Deal Snapshot title
    - Deal reference line (desktop if shown)
    - The metrics grid + breakdown section if expanded
- Quality:
  - Use scale >= 2 for crisp text
  - White background, no transparency weirdness
  - Don’t include the sticky mobile top bar or other page elements

EDGE CASES:
- If breakdown is collapsed, capture collapsed state (don’t auto-expand).
- If the snapshot is hidden due to modal open state, disable button or do nothing.

------------------------------------------------------------
5) QA CHECKLIST
- History shows “Sorted by: Net Yield (Asset) · Highest first”
- History ordering matches that statement
- No broken number formatting anywhere
- Mobile metric line never splits “+£xxx/mo” or “C-o-C x.x%”
- Deal Snapshot shows deal reference on desktop only (when present)
- Capture Snapshot downloads a clean PNG of only the snapshot card

VERSION
- If you track versions, bump patch version by +0.0.1 and keep “February 2026”.
