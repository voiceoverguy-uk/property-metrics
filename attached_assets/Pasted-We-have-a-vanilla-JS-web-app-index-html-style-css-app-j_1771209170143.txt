We have a vanilla JS web app (index.html, style.css, app.js) with Node + Express (server.js). The app already shows a Google Map after the user selects an address.

Please implement ONLY this feature:

FEATURE A — Radius slider + “What’s near here?” toggles (not cluttered)

Goal: Let users optionally show nearby amenities around the selected property, without making the UI messy.

UI REQUIREMENTS (clean + compact)
1) Add a small UI block directly under (or beside) the map titled: “What’s near here?”
2) Include a radius slider with a live label:
   - Default: 1 mile
   - Range: 0.25 to 5 miles
   - Step: 0.25 miles
   - Display in miles (UK)
3) Add toggle “chips” (OFF by default):
   - Supermarkets
   - Schools
   - Transport
   - Parks
   - Healthcare
   - Gyms
4) If no toggles are enabled:
   - Do not show any extra markers
   - UI should stay compact (no blank results sections)
5) Add a “Clear” link/button inside the block that turns all toggles OFF and removes markers.

MAP BEHAVIOUR
1) When a toggle is enabled (or radius changes), show markers for that category within the selected radius.
2) Do not overwhelm the map:
   - Limit results to a sensible max per category (e.g. 10)
   - If 3+ categories are enabled, enable marker clustering automatically.
3) Markers should be visually simple and consistent with the site:
   - Use subtle styling and brand accent (#d42027) where appropriate
   - No huge custom icons, no clutter.

PERFORMANCE
1) Debounce slider changes (e.g. 400–600ms) so it doesn’t spam requests while dragging.
2) Add caching so repeated queries don’t re-hit the API constantly:
   - Cache key: lat,lng,radiusMeters,category
   - Cache TTL: 10 minutes (in-memory is fine)

SECURITY / ARCHITECTURE (IMPORTANT)
Do NOT call Places API directly from the browser.
Implement a server proxy endpoint:

- POST /api/places/nearby
  Request body: { lat, lng, radiusMeters, category }
  Response: return only the fields needed to render markers: name, lat, lng, placeId, rating (optional)

Server should:
- Use Google Places API (New) or appropriate Places endpoint
- Read Google API key from environment variable ONLY (never hardcode)
- Basic rate limiting per IP (simple in-memory is fine)

Category -> Places type mapping
- Supermarkets -> supermarket
- Schools -> school
- Transport -> transit_station (optionally also bus_station)
- Parks -> park
- Healthcare -> doctor (optionally also hospital)
- Gyms -> gym

FILES TO MODIFY
- server.js: add /api/places/nearby proxy, caching, rate limit
- app.js: add UI controls, state, fetch calls, markers, clustering
- style.css: style the UI block to match the existing clean design and red accent

ACCEPTANCE TESTS
- With all toggles off: map looks exactly as it does today
- Enable one toggle: markers appear within selected radius
- Change radius: markers update after debounce
- Clear: removes all markers and resets toggles
- No API key visible in browser DevTools (network tab)
- Works on all routes without breaking mode switching
